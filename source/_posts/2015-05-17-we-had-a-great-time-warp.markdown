Thank you again to all of you who came out to see us last month at our concert!
This semester is just barely over, but we're already preparing for next
semester's events. Be prepared for our concert coming late fall themed "The
Power of Music!"

Also, for any potential "new-vites" out there, we'll be looking for all voice
parts coming in the fall. More information about auditions will be coming soon!
We'll be at all of the Freshman Orientations, so come find us at the org fair!
