Have you ever wanted to be an aca-awesome novite? Now's your chance to become
the newest newvite! We are holding open auditions for Novis on August 22-23
between 2 and 6 PM. We'll be looking for all voice parts.

If you want to audition, the first step is to *email us* at
[novis@novisutd.com][email]. This lets us know that you're interested in
singing for us and gives us a head count of who to expect. We'll email you
back shortly with all the audition materials you'll need to succeed.

The second step is to practice! At the audition, we'll test your range, ask you
to sing your voice part in the Alma Mater (in the email), and give you a short
sight-reading piece. In addition, you get to show off your voice in a short
song of your choice! Don't bring an accompaniment; just sing it!

The third and final step is to *relax*. We want to see you, hear you, meet you,
and find out if you're a good fit for the group. If you want to audition, or if
you've got any questions about auditions or about our group, email us and let
us know. And may the odds be ever in your favor.
