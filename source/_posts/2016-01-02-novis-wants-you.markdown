Winter has come. A new season has befallen the great clan of Novis. And now, as
we prepare to make war against solemn, silent semesters, we want YOU to join
us!

We are auditioning students to join our ranks of a cappella warriors (and
singers) for the spring semester, and we are looking for all voice parts. If
you are interested in singing with us, send us an email at novis@novisutd.com.
You'll be warmly greeted by our president himself, and given instructions for
enrolling your name in the greatest instrument-free ensemble on campus!
Auditions will be held <font color=blue> 3:00-6:00 on Sunday, January 10th in
AH1</font>. Let us know if this time and place will not work for you.

We look forward to getting to meet you, hear you, and know you!
